# üïäÔ∏è flutter_nostr  
### Build scalable, complex & time-consuming decentralized apps in a record time, even if you are new to Flutter/Nostr!


**flutter_nostr** is a modern, developer-friendly toolkit to create Nostr-based apps ‚Äî feeds, chats, identity systems, interaction systems, payment systems or entire decentralized networks ‚Äî **without needing to understand the low-level protocol.**

It provides a high-level, easy-to-use API that abstracts away the complexities of working with Nostr and Flutter, allowing you to focus on building your app's features and user UI/UX.



## Features
- **High-level abstractions**: Work with Nostr concepts like events, relays, and keys without dealing with low-level protocol details.
- **Flutter integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Flutter's widget system and state management solutions.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale applications with ease.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend and customize the toolkit to fit your specific needs.
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Detailed guides and examples to help you get started quickly.
