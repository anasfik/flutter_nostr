# üïäÔ∏è flutter_nostr  
### Build scalable, complex & time-consuming decentralized apps in a record time, even if you are new to Flutter/Nostr!


**flutter_nostr** is a modern, developer-friendly toolkit to create Nostr-based apps ‚Äî feeds, chats, identity systems, interaction systems, payment systems or entire decentralized networks ‚Äî **without needing to understand the low-level protocol.**

It provides a high-level, easy-to-use API that abstracts away the complexities of working with Nostr and Flutter, allowing you to focus on building your app's features and user UI/UX.

## üöÄ Why Choose flutter_nostr?

- **‚ö° Lightning Fast**: Built-in parallel request execution for optimal performance
- **üéØ Developer Experience**: Simple, intuitive API that gets you started in minutes
- **üîÑ Real-time**: Automatic pagination, refresh, and infinite scroll support
- **üõ°Ô∏è Type Safe**: Full TypeScript-like type safety with Dart's strong typing
- **üì± Flutter Native**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter's widget system and state management
- **üåê Production Ready**: Handles errors, loading states, and edge cases out of the box



## Features
- **High-level abstractions**: Work with Nostr concepts like events, relays, and keys without dealing with low-level protocol details.
- **Flutter integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Flutter's widget system and state management solutions.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale applications with ease.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend and customize the toolkit to fit your specific needs.
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Detailed guides and examples to help you get started quickly.


## Quick Start

### 1. Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_nostr: ^0.1.0
```

### 2. Initialize Flutter Nostr:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_nostr/flutter_nostr.dart';

void main() async {
  await FlutterNostr.init(relays: ['wss://relay.damus.io']);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### 3. Create a Nostr Feed in 3 lines:
```dart
FlutterNostrFeed(
  filters: [NostrFilter(kinds: [1], limit: 20)], // Get latest notes
  builder: (context, data, options) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: data.events.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        final event = data.events[index];
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(event.content ?? ''),
          subtitle: Text('by ${event.pubkey}'),
        );
      },
    );
  },
)
```

### 4. Advanced Feed with User Profiles:
```dart
FlutterNostrFeed(
  filters: [NostrFilter(kinds: [1], limit: 20)],
  parallelRequestRequestsHandler: (events) {
    // Automatically fetch user profiles for each event
    return ParallelRequest(
      id: "profiles",
      filters: [NostrFilter(
        kinds: [0], // Profile events
        authors: events.map((e) => e.pubkey).toList(),
      )],
      adapter: (event) => jsonDecode(event.content!),
    );
  },
  builder: (context, data, options) {
    final profiles = data.parallelRequestResults?["profiles"] ?? [];
    
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: data.events.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        final event = data.events[index];
        final profile = profiles.firstWhere(
          (p) => p.event.pubkey == event.pubkey,
          orElse: () => null,
        );
        
        return Card(
          child: ListTile(
            leading: CircleAvatar(
              backgroundImage: profile?.adaptedResults['picture'] != null
                ? NetworkImage(profile!.adaptedResults['picture'])
                : null,
            ),
            title: Text(profile?.adaptedResults['name'] ?? event.pubkey),
            subtitle: Text(event.content ?? ''),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  },
)
```
